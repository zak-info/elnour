## Getting Started

### 1. Start Development Server

npm run dev
```
Server runs on: **http://localhost:3001**

### 2. Login
- Navigate to: `/signin`
- Enter credentials:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`
- Click "Sign In"

## Data Storage

Currently using **in-memory storage** (array):

### To Add Database:
1. Install database client (e.g., Prisma, Mongoose)
2. Update server actions in `professor.actions.ts`
3. Replace array with database queries
4. Keep same API interface
